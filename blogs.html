			Welcome to stormbreaker's blog!  As of right now, this is not a regularly updated blog nor do I expect it to ever be.  However, whenever there is a new update to any of my projects
			(when I have the chance to work on any projects), you will be sure to find information about it here.  I may also post links to and discussions about advances in the technological/programming
			world.  You may also find the occasional rant about issues not related to technology, but rather my thoughts on society.  In addition, if I have some pretty crazy ideas for technology
			I may post them here.  
			</p>
			<p id = "posttext">
			Yes, I know my whole site and the blog posts in particular are a bit "plain" right now.  I threw this current version up in about a week and a half with little to no experience in either
			HTML or CSS.  My personal thoughts are that this is good (not excellent but good) for a first attempt with a limited amount of time.  I expect to be able to revise, adapt, expand, and otherwise
			improve the site bit by tiny bit over the next few months. Please bear with me and enjoy!
