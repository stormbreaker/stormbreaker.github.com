			<p class "posttext">It is pathetic, but I will admit that I forgot that today was Pearl Harbor Day until I was reminded by someone else.  
			Normally, my family would put out the flag, but with all the snow, we have no outward sign of remembering this day.  However, the flag will
			be figuratively flown in rememberance of all veterans, particularly those who fought in World War II. </p>
			<p class "posttext">I would just ask that you also remember our veterans.  Thank you for your service!</p>

			<h1 class = "posttitle">Short Dissertation on the Quirks of Pre-Calc</h1>
			<p class = "posttext">"Math is confusing!"  I hear it all the time from multiple people.  I finally see where they are coming from.
			</p>
			<p class = "posttext">
			Last night while doing pre-calc review problems for my calculus class, I stumbled upon this equation: f(t) = (4 - t^2)/(2 - t).  A rational
			function but despite its ungainly appearance, it's not really too hard.  Right?  Well, yes.  Sometimes.
			</p>
			<p class = "posttext">
			I believe everyone would agree with me that this problem can be simplified and that this is done in the following manner:
			</p>
			<p>
			f(t) = (4 - t^2)/(2 - t)
			</p>
			<p>
			f(t) = ((2 - t)(2 + t))/(2 - t)
			</p>
			<p>
			f(t) = (2 + t)
			</p>
			<p class = "posttext">
			Makes sense right? (4 - t^2)/(2 - t) = (2 + t).  Looks good, but is it really?  Let's do some domain and range to find out.
			</p>
			<p class = "posttext">
			Let's consider f(t) = (2 + t):
			</p>
			<p>
			Linear function.  No specified domain limits, thus it has none.  Domain is: (-∞, ∞).
			</p>
			<p class = "posttext">
			That was simple.  So if (4 - t^2)/(2 - t) = (2 + t) then shouldn't the domain of f(t) = (4 - t^2)/(2 - t) also be (-∞, ∞)?  One would think so.
			However, a closer examination proves otherwise:
			</p>
			<p>
			Rational function.  No specified domain limit, however because of the rational nature, there must be. Calculated:
			</p>
			<p>
			(2 - t) > 0 or (2 - t) &lt; 0 so that denominator is != 0.
			</p>
			<p>
			2 - t > 0 or 2 - t &lt; 0
			</p>
			<p>
			2 > t or 2 &lt; t
			</p>
			<p>
			t &lt; 2 or t > 2
			</p>
			<p>
			Domain is then: (-∞, 2) U (2, ∞)
			</p>
			<p class = "posttext">
			If you were to graph both of these mathematically equal equations, you would get the same line albeit the second equation we found the domain for would have
			a hole at 2.  This is NOT the same as a line that continues on forever.  The equations are the same yet not the same.  Strange but true.

			<h1 class = "posttitle">First Blog!</h1>
			<p class = "posttext">This first post is more of an overview than anything.  You will also find this information in the "About" page.
			</p>
			<p class = "posttext">
			Welcome to stormbreaker's blog!  Even though this is not intended to be a regular blog, you will be sure to find information about my projects every chance that I have to work on them.
			I may also post links to and discussions about advances in the technological/programming world as well as the occasional rant about issues not related to technology, but rather to
			society.  In addition, I occasionally have incredible technological ideas, many of which I will post here.
			I may post them here.  
			</p>
			<p class = "posttext">
			I am aware that the site and the blog posts in particular are a bit "plain" right now.  I created this in about a week and a half and with little to no experience in either
			HTML or CSS.  My personal thoughts are that this is good first attempt  I expect to revise, adapt, expand, and otherwise
			improve the site bit by tiny bit (with the occasional byte) over the next few months. Please bear with me and enjoy!
