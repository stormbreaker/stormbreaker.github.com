			Welcome to stormbreaker's blog!  Even though this is not intended to be a regular blog, you will be sure to find information about my projects every chance that I have to work on them.
			I may also post links to and discussions about advances in the technological/programming world as well as the occasional rant about issues not related to technology, but rather to
			society.  In addition, I occasionally have incredible technological ideas, many of which I will post here.
			I may post them here.

			<p id = "posttext">
			I am aware that the site and the blog posts in particular are a bit "plain" right now.  I created this in about a week and a half and with little to no experience in either
			HTML or CSS.  My personal thoughts are that this is good first attempt  I expect to revise, adapt, expand, and otherwise
			improve the site bit by tiny bit (with the occasional byte) over the next few months. Please bear with me and enjoy!
