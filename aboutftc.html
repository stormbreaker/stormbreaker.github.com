<h1>FIRST</h1><p>
For Inspiration and Recognition of Technology (FIRST) is an organization founded by inventor Dean Kamen in 1989 to develop ways to inspire students in engineering and technology fields. The organization is the foundation for the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST LEGO League, Junior FIRST LEGO League, and FIRST Tech Challenge competitions.
 
FIRST also operates FIRST Place, a research facility at FIRST Headquarters in Manchester, New Hampshire, where it holds educational programs and day camps for students and teachers.

<h2>FIRST's Philosophy</h2>
 
FIRST seeks to promote a philosophy of teamwork and collaboration among engineers and encourages competing teams to remain friendly, helping each other out when necessary. Terms frequently applied to this ethos are Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition; terms coined by Woodie Flowers and Kamen that support respect towards one's competitors and integrity in one's actions.  The concept of Gracious Professionalism grew from a robotics class that Flowers taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Coopertition is patented under US Patent 7,507,169 by Dean Kamen.
