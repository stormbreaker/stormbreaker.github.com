	<h1>About Us</h1><p>
	We are a group of homeschool students from Cheyenne, WY that are interested in robotics, computers, and engineering.  This is our first year in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) however, most of us have had experience in the things required for FTC.  Two of our members have had experience with a similar program entitled FIRST LEGO League (FLL) via the Laramie County 4-H robotics program.  Our ages range from 15 years old to 17 years old.  
<p>
<h1>Our Goals</h1><p>
	We are out to learn all that we can about robotics and engineering.  Along the way, we hope to have a good time as well as perhaps place high in the competitions.  We also wish to develop the virtues of "gracious professionalism" and "coopertition".  Please see <a href = "http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism" target = "_blank">this link</a> for more information.
